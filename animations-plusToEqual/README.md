# CSS Animations I
## Plus to Equal Transition
While I was playing with the hamburger menu animation that becomes a cross sign on click, I came up with this idea where a plus sign becomes an equal sign on click. This can be used in calculators, etc.

**PS Will post the hamburger menu animation soon as well**
