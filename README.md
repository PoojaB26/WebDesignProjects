Self teaching web design tools and techniques. The idea is to create a basic website with minimal features as I begin and then go onto to make complex websites and even copies of popular websites.

*I initially started designing and then got into developing Android applications. I currently have 1 app in the Play Store with more than 10K downloads and more than 5-6 personal Android projects that I either built for myself or hackathons. I find Android development really interesting but over the years, website design has transformed into a different high which got me curious about the work behind all the lovely stuff I see on the screen. So here I am trying to explore the world of Website development.*
