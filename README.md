# Web Design Basics

Self teaching web design tools and techniques. The idea is to create a web design element or a basic website with minimal features as I begin and then go onto to make complex websites and even copies of popular websites.

*I initially started designing and then got into developing Android applications 2 years ago. I currently have a released educational app in the Play Store with more than 10K downloads, a former internship in Android UI development and UX design and about 5-6 personal Android projects that I either built for myself or hackathons. I find Android development really interesting but over the years, website design has really caught my attention. It got me curious about the work behind all the interesting stuff I see on screen. Since I am just a sophomore, I thought it's also necessary to broaden my skills so that its easier to choose a field later on.*

*I hope you enjoy building websites with me. For any query, contact me at pbhaumik26@gmail.com.*
